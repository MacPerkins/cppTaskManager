# Overview

The program, a to-do list, will allow users to create, remove, and view tasks in a to-do list, as well as allow users to write all their tasks to a file and read them.

The software consists of a class called tasks with accompanying modules that add tasks, remove tasks, view tasks, and read and write the tasks to a file.

My purpose in writing this was to showcase my learning of C++ for the past 2 weeks of study. I am trying to further my learning of a diverse amount of coding languages as part of building up good hard skills to use as a software developer in the future.

# Development Environment

Programming language: C++.

Coding enviroment: Visual Studio Code.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites I found helpful in creating this project:

- [CPP Tutorial - W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)
- [STL Containers - cplusplus](https://cplusplus.com/reference/stl/)

# Future Work
- Add validation to user input
- Add error handling in the case of incorrect user input, failure to write or read to a file.
